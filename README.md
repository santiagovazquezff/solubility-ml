# solubility-ml-project
## Overview
The dataset consists of molecular descriptors calculated from chemical structures, with aqueous solubility (log mol/L) as the target variable. Two regression models were implemented and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
  
The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing.

## Results
Both models explain approximately 75â€“78% of the variance in aqueous solubility. Linear Regression performed slightly better than Random Forest on this dataset, suggesting that the relationship between molecular descriptors and solubility is largely linear.
